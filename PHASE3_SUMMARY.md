## 🎯 Tracking Algorithm Details

### Kalman Filter State Vector
```
State: [x, y, w, h, vx, vy, vw, vh]
- (x, y): Center position
- (w, h): Bounding box dimensions  
- (vx, vy): Velocity components
- (vw, vh): Size change velocities
```

### Feature Extraction Pipeline
```
Player Crop → CNN Encoder → 256D Features → L2 Normalize → Cosine Similarity
```

### Track Association Process
```
1. Predict all track positions (Kalman)
2. Extract appearance features (CNN)
3. Compute motion distances (IoU, center)
4. Compute appearance distances (cosine)
5. Combine with weights (motion: 30%, appearance: 70%)
6. Solve assignment (Hungarian algorithm)
7. Update matched tracks, create new tracks
```
